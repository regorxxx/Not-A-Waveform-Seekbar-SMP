UI panel which displays a seekbar, using a graphical representation
of the track via audiowaveform or ffprobe. May be based on RMS, peak
levels, the actual waveform or visualization presets.

Mode:
-----
There are 3 possibilities:
- Audiowaveform: faster. Displays the waveform as is.
- ffprobe: slower. Multiple analysis options available (RMS, peak
 or RMS peaks).
- Visualizer: may be used to show a random animation which changes
according to BPM (if %BPM% tag exists). This mode does not analyze
tracks.

Analysis data:
--------------
- Analysis data is cached on files which are saved according to a
configurable TF expression.
- Files are heavily compressed, using less than 2Kb in most cases.
File size is greatly reduced in comparison to other waveform UI
components storing similar data.
- Since the script tries to load data files first, non compatible
formats like SACD, ISO files or zipped files may be converted
to compatible ones, analyzed and then deleted. As long as these
incompatible tracks share the same path, the script will load the
associated data files when playing them and display the seekbar
properly (even if the track can not be analyzed on real time).

UI usage:
---------
- Fully configurable using the R. Click menu.
- Mot recommended anything below 100 ms for refresh rate.
- Variable refresh rate may be used to automatically adjust it
according to system responsiveness.
- There are multiple display options but all use the same data.
- Background is fully configurable.

Other UI usage:
---------------
Press Shift + Win + R. Click to open SMP/JSpliter panel menu
(which works globally on any script and panel, at any position).

FAQ:
----
- Some tracks are not analyzed:
	+ Check 'Mode\Show Compatible extensions'. The list
of compatible files depends on the mode (binary) used. You
can convert them to a compatible format, analyze them and 
delete the converted tracks afterwards though. Analyis

	+ The tracks are within a compressed file. This is
not supported, although if associated analysis files are
found, they will be used.

	+ Otherwise check the analysis files TF path at 
'Analysis\File name format...'. Exotic paths, chars, artist 
names or setups should be handled by the user.
