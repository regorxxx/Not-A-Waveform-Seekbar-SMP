UI panel which displays a seekbar, using a graphical representation
of the track via audiowaveform or ffprobe. May be based on RMS, peak
levels, the actual waveform or visualization presets.

Mode:
-----
There are 3 possibilities:
- Audiowaveform: faster. Displays the waveform as is.
- ffprobe: slower. Multiple analysis options available (RMS, peak
 or RMS peaks).
- Visualizer: may be used to show a random animation which changes
according to BPM (if %BPM% tag exists). This mode does not analyze
tracks.

Analysis data:
--------------
- Analysis data is cached on files which are saved according to a
configurable TF expression.
- There are multiple settings to control how analysis data files
are saved or auto-deleted.
- Files are heavily compressed, using less than 2Kb in most cases.
File size is greatly reduced in comparison to other waveform UI
components storing similar data.
- Since the script tries to load data files first, non compatible
formats like SACD, ISO files or zipped files may be converted
to compatible ones, analyzed and then deleted. As long as these
incompatible tracks share the same path, the script will load the
associated data files when playing them and display the seekbar
properly (even if the track can not be analyzed on real time).
- By default data is downmixed to mono, but there is also a
setting to enable multi-channel analysis.

UI usage:
---------
- Fully configurable using the R. Click menu.
- Mot recommended anything below 100 ms for refresh rate.
- Variable refresh rate may be used to automatically adjust it
according to system responsiveness.
- There are multiple display options but all use the same data.
- Background is fully configurable.
- On multi-channel mode, channels shown may be selectively set.

Other UI usage:
---------------
Press Shift + Win + R. Click to open SMP/JSplitter panel menu
(which works globally on any script and panel, at any position).

FAQ:
----
- VU Meter smoothness:
	+ It's recommended to use ffprobe instead of Audiowaveform
	when using the VU Meter preset, since it's analysis data has
	higher precision, resulting on a smoother animation.

- Some tracks are not analyzed:
	+ Check 'Mode\Show Compatible extensions'. The list
	of compatible files depends on the mode (binary) used. You
	can convert them to a compatible format, analyze them and
	delete the converted tracks afterwards though.

	+ If tracks are within a compressed file. This is
	not supported, although if associated analysis files are
	found, they will be used.

	+ Otherwise check the analysis files TF path at
	'Analysis\File name format...'. Exotic paths, chars, artist
	names or setups should be handled by the user.

- How to control dynamic colors artwork source:
	+ It can be set at the background 'cover mode' sub-menu.

	+ Selection/now playing source can be set at same sub-menu.

- How to show the artwork as background instead of a solid color:
	+ Cover mode transparency must be non-zero, and slider background
	color must be disabled (-none-) too. In such case the background
	ill be governed only by the background sub-menu settings.
	Adjusting the transparency and color mode, different overlays
	may be drawn too.
